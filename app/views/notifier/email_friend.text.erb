Notice how you add three arguments: article, sender_name, and receiver_email. You start by defining two instance variables @article and @sender_name to make them available in your view template. Then, you modify
the mail method call to send the e-mail to the receiver_email address with the subject “Interesting Article.” Next, you want your e-mail message to have some sort of formatting and include the URL of your application. Change the template file located in app/views/notifier/email_friend.text.erb and make it look like the code in Listing 10-8.
